One day during my college days, I sat near my roommate to complete the project. He was using his laptop and I was amazed at seeing his working speed. He operated things like switching tabs, opening developer tools, jumping to the address bar, etc blazingly fast without using mousepad. He memorized and practiced keyboard shortcut keys of the browser to work flawlessly. Everything looked so professional and cool as if he is the master of the machine.

I liked his skill and desired to learn it too. I learned the shortcuts and it felt like the browser dancing at my command.
