I was scrolling the twitter feed and got the idea of this tool. Never thought that so many developers will find it useful.

The open-source community is amazing. The project on GitHub received two pull requests without even opening an issue.

**Thorsten L√ºnborg**, a member of the Vuejs core team even starred the repositoryüôá.

## How I achieved it?
Now the question is How I did it. The strategy I followed is a mix of a few steps which are as follows

#### 1. Make project README visually interesting
Project README on Github puts the first impression of the project. To win the battle i.e to gain attention I designed a visually interesting README using **gifs**, **badges**, and **emojis**. It looks like this

#### 2. Make developers aware on **dev.to**
I am quite active on dev.to and understands the power of it. So I wrote this article for the same

Guess what, it got 1400+ views. Organic reach is pretty amazing on dev.to.

#### 3. Make developers aware on other platforms(LinkedIn/Reddit/Discord/Twitter)
I am quite active on LinkedIn too. So I took advantage of this and wrote a post regarding the tool. Organic reach of LinkedIn is amazing too and the post was reaching 1000+ people per hour for the first 12 hours. The post became a hit and reached 24000+ people on LinkedIn.

That's it! Dev.to and LinkedIn proved out to be a super awesome platform to reach the targetted audience organically.
