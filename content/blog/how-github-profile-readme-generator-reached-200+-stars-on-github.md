My open-source project **Github profile README generator** reached 1000+ ‚≠êÔ∏è in less than 45 days ü•≥.

It was trending on Github under javascript categoryüöÄ

I was scrolling the twitter feed and listening to **Blinding Lights** when I got the idea of this tool. Never thought that so many developers will find it useful.

The open-source community is amazing. The project on GitHub received two pull requests without even opening an issue.

- [Nat Friedman](https://twitter.com/natfriedman?lang=en) **CEO of GitHub** followed me on twitter.
- [Thorsten L√ºnborg](https://twitter.com/linus_borg?lang=en), a member of the Vuejs core team even starred the repositoryüôá.

## How I achieved it?
Now the question is How I did it. The strategy I followed is a mix of a few steps which are as follows

#### 1. Cool project README
Project README on Github puts the first impression of the project. To win the battle i.e to gain attention I designed a visually interesting README using **gifs**, **badges**, and **emojis**. It looks like this

#### 2. Post about project on Dev.to using #showdev
I am quite active on dev.to and understands the power of it. So I wrote [this article](https://dev.to/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator-with-addons-like-visitors-count-github-stats-etc-44bg) for the same.

Guess what, it got 1400+ views. Organic reach is pretty amazing on dev.to.
Your blog post must display the capabilities and uniqueness about the project.


#### 3. Promote the project on other platforms(LinkedIn/Reddit/Discord/Twitter)
I am quite active on LinkedIn too. So I took advantage of this and wrote a post regarding the tool. Organic reach of LinkedIn is amazing too and the post was reaching 1000+ people per hour for the first 12 hours. The post became a hit and reached 24000+ people on LinkedIn.

That's it! Dev.to and LinkedIn proved out to be a super awesome platform to reach the targetted audience organically.
