Github recently released profile README feature, which became a hit among developers. As it provides good place to showcase current projects and skills, many addons like `visitors-count`, `github-stats` has been developed.

I got tired of updating my github profile README again and again to get:
- uniformity in dev/social icons
- cool and minimal look
- new features like visitors-count or github-stats

So I came up with an amazing tool to make this an easy experience. **Github Profile README Generator** tool provides a beautiful UI to create the same.

![Github Profile README Generator](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rlxrzf3yjd2pbnp18nme.gif)

It lets you add the latest add-ons like visitors count, shields, dev icons, github stats, etc to your README in just one click.

Just fill the details like `Name`, `Tagline`, `Dev Platforms Username`, `Current Work`, `Portfolio`, `Blog` etc using minimal UI.

Try the tool: [live demo](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/)

Click on `Generate README` button after filling the form, to get your README in markdown. You can preview the README too.

This project is developed using Gatsby and can be found on github at [Github Profile Readme Generator](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator)

Give it a try if it sounds interesting.
