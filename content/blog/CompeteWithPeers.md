#### **What is the basic difference between a student graduating from IIT and a student graduating from Tier 2/ Tier 3 College in India?**

Quality answer to this question is given by [Aman Goel](https://in.linkedin.com/in/amangoeliitb), who is a Computer Science graduate from IIT Bombay. He is currently working as the CEO of AllinCall Research & Solutions.

I am quoting his answer on Quora:

> Since I am from a Computer Science background, I will write from that
> point of view. Also, my answer would primarily be useful for those who
> are still in college.
> 
> At IITs, by-and-large, we follow a template aside from our usual
> college curriculum. If you observe carefully, most of the courses are
> the same in almost any institute. Clearly, that is not the difference
> creator. This template is what creates a difference. This template is
> what most people follow which helps them develop the right skills for
> the industry.
> 
> - **Year 1**: Get extremely good at writing code. As a first step, it is important that you are absolutely comfortable with writing code.
> Given an algorithm's explanation, you should be able to implement it
> in no time. I have seen many people start Android app development in
> the first year. Do you know how to write code? If not, focus on that.
> Leave Android app development for later years.
> -   **Year 2**: Learn problem-solving. You can do so by practising a lot of problems on various online judges like CodeChef, SPOJ,
> CodeForces, etc. Competitive Programming opens up your mind and helps
> you think faster and better. As a college student, it should be among
> the top things in your priority list. Participate in Programming
> contests like ACM ICPC. Achievements in these contests really shine on
> your resume. Please note that I am not marketing for Competitive
> Programming. I am marketing for problem-solving. Competitive
> Programming happens to be one of the best ways to learn
> problem-solving at the college level.
> -   **Year 3**: Learn backend development in at least 1 well-known programming language. I'd personally recommend Python since it is
> extremely popular in the market. You can alternatively try learning
> JavaScript (NodeJS) or Ruby (RoR). Being good at 1 backend framework
> opens up a huge chunk of the market for you. I have seen that a lot of
> students try to learn 10 different languages while they know nothing
> about any of them. All they know is the basic syntax of loops,
> if-statements, etc. Trust me, this is wasteful. You should rather be a
> master at 1 or 2 programming languages. What you should however know
> is the technique to pick-up any new tool/technology/programming
> language. If your concepts are right, it would take you no time to
> switch languages.
> -   **Year 4**: Learn new technologies like Machine Learning, Blockchain, etc. In todayâ€™s fast-moving world, it is important that
> you stay relevant to the market demands. This will help you create a
> competitive edge over your competitors.
> 
> Do not flip the order. Do not learn Machine Learning when you barely
> know how to write code or solve problems. Almost every company today
> takes a DS/Algo round. Make sure that you are able to crack it. If you
> have mastered the art of problem-solving, everything would be easy for
> you, be it Android, be it web, be it ML/AI.
