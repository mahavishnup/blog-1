He is currently working as the CEO of AllinCall Research &#x26; Solutions.</p>\n<p>I am quoting his answer on Quora:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since I am from a Computer Science background, I will write from that\npoint of view. Also, my answer would primarily be useful for those who\nare still in college.</p>\n<p>At IITs, by-and-large, we follow a template aside from our usual\ncollege curriculum. If you observe carefully, most of the courses are\nthe same in almost any institute. Clearly, that is not the difference\ncreator. This template is what creates a difference. This template is\nwhat most people follow which helps them develop the right skills for\nthe industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Year 1</strong>: Get extremely good at writing code. As a first step, it is important that you are absolutely comfortable with writing code.\nGiven an algorithmâ€™s explanation, you should be able to implement it\nin no time. I have seen many people start Android app development in\nthe first year. Do you know how to write code? If not, focus on that.\nLeave Android app development for later years.</li>\n<li><strong>Year 2</strong>: Learn problem-solving. You can do so by practising a lot of problems on various online judges like CodeChef, SPOJ,\nCodeForces, etc. Competitive Programming opens up your mind and helps\nyou think faster and better. As a college student, it should be among\nthe top things in your priority list. Participate in Programming\ncontests like ACM ICPC. Achievements in these contests really shine on\nyour resume. Please note that I am not marketing for Competitive\nProgramming. I am marketing for problem-solving. Competitive\nProgramming happens to be one of the best ways to learn\nproblem-solving at the college level.</li>\n<li><strong>Year 3</strong>: Learn backend development in at least 1 well-known programming language. Iâ€™d personally recommend Python since it is\nextremely popular in the market. You can alternatively try learning\nJavaScript (NodeJS) or Ruby (RoR). Being good at 1 backend framework\nopens up a huge chunk of the market for you. I have seen that a lot of\nstudents try to learn 10 different languages while they know nothing\nabout any of them. All they know is the basic syntax of loops,\nif-statements, etc. Trust me, this is wasteful. You should rather be a\nmaster at 1 or 2 programming languages. What you should however know\nis the technique to pick-up any new tool/technology/programming\nlanguage. If your concepts are right, it would take you no time to\nswitch languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Year 4</strong>: Learn new technologies like Machine Learning, Blockchain, etc. In todayâ€™s fast-moving world, it is important that\nyou stay relevant to the market demands. This will help you create a\ncompetitive edge over your competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do not flip the order. Do not learn Machine Learning when you barely\nknow how to write code or solve problems. Almost every company today\ntakes a DS/Algo round. Make sure that you are able to crack it. If you\nhave mastered the art of problem-solving, everything would be easy for\nyou, be it Android, be it web, be it ML/AI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source - <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-compete-with-the-students-studying-in-IITs-while-studying-in-a-mediocre-college\">https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-compete-with-the-students-studying-in-IITs-while-studying-in-a-mediocre-college</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ’ª Studying in a mediocre college makes you weak?
