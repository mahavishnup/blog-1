In just 45 days the project got 1000+ stars on GitHub. It received sponsorships from two experienced developers. Google Analytics reads that it got 10,000+ visitors so far. Got featured in several YouTube videos and blogs.</p>\n<p>I believe that sharing the process followed by me will help you to get the gist of the same. Go through the following steps sequentially to understand the whole process.</p>\n<h2>1. Wireframe the IDEA 🖊</h2>\n<p>Take a pen &#x26; paper and just draw the IDEA. Don’t worry about your drawing ability and just jot down the IDEA. It will help you to rob the IDEA from the brain to the paper.\nNow you have the IDEA, start drawing how it should work. Brainstorm every possible workflow you have in mind.</p>\n<p>I was seeing a lot of addons to GitHub profile README coming up, so I came up with the idea of <a href=\"https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator\">GitHub Profile README Generator</a>.</p>\n<p>I brainstormed several ideas on how should make it simple, useful, and elegant for users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/BfBqQV47hLFh6/giphy.gif\" alt=\"best idea\"></p>\n<p>Once you get the holistic picture of what you are thinking, pick the best one, and freeze it.</p>\n<h2>2. Execute 👨‍💻</h2>\n<p>Almost every one of us usually loses interest to develop the project after coming up with an IDEA. Is it really worth it? People really gonna use it or am I just wasting my time? etc questions like this start haunting the mind.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZQrVQtav6gnzG/giphy.gif\" alt=\"confused\"></p>\n<p>This happened to me too and said it to myself that <strong>Who cares?</strong>. Yep, it’s true who cares.</p>\n<p>So stop thinking about it and just execute it. It doesn’t matter whether people will like it or not, the experience of going from an idea in the mind to the idea online is simply amazing.</p>\n<h2>3. Promote 🚀</h2>\n<p>Let the world know about the masterpiece you’ve developed. To reach a wider audience for feedback, promotion is very important. This step will make you realize the power of platforms like <strong>DEV</strong>, <strong>Reddit</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, and <strong>YouTube</strong>, etc.\nI’ve posted a separate blog on <a href=\"https://rahuldkjain.github.io/blog/how-github-profile-readme-generator-reached-200+-stars-on-github/\">how to promote your project online?</a>. Go check and read it out.</p>\n<p>I am telling you that having an amazing open-source project is an amazing feeling for developers like me. So don’t think and wait, just execute it. Let the world know about your crazy ideas, don’t hesitate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/kEKcOWl8RMLde/giphy.gif\" alt=\"happy\"></p>\n<p>Wish you very good luck on your upcoming journey.\nHappy Coding 👨‍💻👩‍💻!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to start and promote your open-source project?","date":"August 26, 2020","description":"Steps that I followed to start and promote my project that got 1000+ stars on github"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/promote-open-source-project/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docker/docker-compose/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker Compose"}},"next":null}}}
